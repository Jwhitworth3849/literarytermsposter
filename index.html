            <h2 class="title">Symbolism</h2>
            <p class="assignmentText">My favorite example of symbolism is in the book 
                “Touching Spirit Bear” by Ben Mikaelsen. In this story the most obvious 
                choice for symbolism would be the spirit bear itself, but I have a hard 
                time connecting the spirit bear with Cole’s personality.  Instead I’m 
                choosing fire, to symbolize Cole's anger. The quote “Cole stared suddenly 
                into the fire, then let his gaze wander. He had wanted revenge but felt 
                little joy from this act.” shows this very well.

                This submission was created by myself and Marcus, using an ai tool to
                generate this image because we couldn't find one we liked on google. we
                decided to submit it via webpage because we had time to kill. This webpage
                was published with the use of github, an online web hosting tool.
